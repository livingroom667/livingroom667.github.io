## What we know about Iran's missile attack on Israel

**3 October 2024**  

Iran launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles towards Israel on Tuesday night, causing alarms to ring out across the country as civilians sought shelter. While the majority of the missiles were intercepted by Israel's advanced defense systems, a few managed to reach targets in central and southern Israel. One Palestinian man in the occupied West Bank was reported to have been killed. This marks the second major missile strike by Iran this year, following a similar attack in April.

### The Scale of the Attack

Israeli defense officials confirmed that over 180 missiles were launched, closely aligning with Iranian media claims of about 200. The U.S. Department of Defense characterized the event as nearly twice the scale of the previous strike in April. 

Alarms blared across the entire nation of Israel, home to roughly 10 million people, around 7:30 p.m. local time. Video evidence captured missiles flying over the densely populated cities of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem shortly thereafter, with many intercepted by air defense systems. However, some missiles reached their intended targets, striking areas around key military and intelligence installations, including the Nevatim airbase and Mossad headquarters.

An Israeli military spokesperson indicated that while several missiles struck near strategic locations, the country’s air defense system, bolstered by U.S.-led efforts, successfully intercepted the majority. 

### Reported Damage and Casualties

Though several Israeli air force bases sustained damage, military officials stated that no critical infrastructure, weapons, or aircraft were destroyed. The attack was said to have primarily impacted administrative buildings. Some damage occurred in civilian areas, mostly due to missile shrapnel from interceptions.  

Near Mossad’s headquarters in the Tel Aviv area, multiple cars were severely damaged by the impacts. The municipality of Hod HaSharon, north of Tel Aviv, reported that around 100 houses were damaged due to a missile strike. 

The Israeli medical response team treated two people in Tel Aviv for minor injuries caused by shrapnel. Additionally, a man in the West Bank city of Jericho was killed by falling debris from the missiles.

### How Effective Were Israeli Defenses?

Israel’s missile defense systems, including Iron Dome, were heavily involved in intercepting the incoming missiles. While Israel refrained from providing specific interception numbers, it praised the “high rates of success” in neutralizing the threat. However, the exact breakdown of missile defense system use remains unclear, as Israel aims to avoid giving adversaries tactical insights.  

Alongside Iron Dome, systems like David’s Sling, which is used for intercepting medium-to-long range rockets, and Arrow 2 and 3 systems, designed to stop long-range ballistic missiles, likely played a role in intercepting the barrage. The U.S. military also reportedly contributed by firing interceptors from Navy destroyers positioned in the Eastern Mediterranean.

### Why Did Iran Launch This Attack?

According to Iranian military officials, the missile barrage was a retaliatory measure in response to what they described as violations of Iran's sovereignty. The strike was framed as a reaction to the killing of key regional figures, including Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, both of whom died in targeted attacks. Iranian authorities claimed Israel was responsible for their deaths. 

The attack also followed Israeli military operations in southern Lebanon, which were aimed at neutralizing Hezbollah targets. Hezbollah, a militant group backed by Iran, has been involved in an ongoing cross-border conflict with Israel. 

### Israel’s Response

In response to the missile strike, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that Iran’s attack had largely failed, with the majority of missiles being intercepted. He warned that Iran had “made a grave mistake” and would face repercussions. 

Israeli defense officials echoed similar sentiments, promising retaliation for the attack. The extent and timing of Israel’s response remain uncertain, though military experts suggest that strategic Iranian sites may be targeted in the future.

### International Reactions

The global community, including the United States and European nations, swiftly condemned Iran’s missile strike. U.S. President Joe Biden reaffirmed American support for Israel, while calling the attack “ineffective.” Other Western leaders, including the UK and France, also expressed solidarity with Israel, emphasizing the need to avoid further escalation.

Iran, meanwhile, has vowed to respond with full force should Israel take further military actions, raising concerns over the potential for broader regional conflict.
